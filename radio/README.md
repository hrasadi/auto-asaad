# Radio Auto-asaad

Auto-asaad has been shown to be effective for broadcasting notification
thoughout communities using text messages. However, I found that having a 
variety of media forms is a nice thing to have. And it is not hard to guess
that radio is a desirable choice to touch both because it covers the multimedia
ground and not so hard (or resource intensive) to build at the same time.

Several online radio frameworks are already avaialble. One free and open 
solution is [Liquidsoap](http://liquidsoap.fm/). Liquidsoap uses a 
script-based approach to define playlists and schedule playbacks from various 
input sources. While Liquidsoap supports dynamic media selection using bash script
connectors; making that part to work requires extensive external coding. Radio 
auto-asaad is a set of scripts built on top of Liquidsoap, in addition to 
a standalone implementation tuned for macOS systems, with the goal of defining 
dynamic and scheduled program playbacks.
