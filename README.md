# Auto-asaad
Auto-asaad is developed as a social media companion and notification manager. 
This may look quite vague of a project description to you. Well, guess what! 
It is vague for me too :) I have started this project out of need for 
an easier/more automated
way to push notifications to messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp and Telegram).
It then extended to building a simple online radio module so that I can
broadcast my notifications at the desired points of time! Afterall, radio was 
one of the first social networks out there, wasn't it?!

The idea is to develop several mini-applications using this toolset. I 
commit these applications as they are being developed. Of couse each use-case
will reveal new challenges that will reflect on the framework itself.
