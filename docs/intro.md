# Architectural Overview
Auto-asaad is basically a set of scripts that provide various features to develop
social media bots. The initial focus of auto-asaad was messaging platforms 
(and specially Telegram). However, the scripts can easily get expanded to support a 
larger variaty of platforms.

The main use-case for auto-asaad can be stated as follows:

_We want to automatically notify our service subscribers on a specific point(s)
of time by sending them a message with customized text. The time for sending 
the messages may also change every day and is not necessarily fixed._
